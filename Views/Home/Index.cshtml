                I often like to remind myself that learning is a skill.
                You need to learn to learn and like anything else the more you practice the better you get.
                Your brain is like a map and everytime you learn you build a road.
                Naturally with more roads you get from one place to another quicker.

                Besides learning I also enjoy traveling. Below is a map of cities that I've traveled to.

                I look forward to the next pin :)
